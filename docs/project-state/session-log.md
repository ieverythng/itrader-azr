# Session Log

## 2026-09-03 - Episode/Regime Alignment Ablation Scaffolded + Stash Audit

- Changed: Created ablation config (4 variants v0-v3), regime tagger, capability reporter, and Lazarus launcher script. Recovered `p_solve` hook in ps_metrics.py from stash@{1}. Updated next-actions.md, current-state.md, decisions.md.
- Validation: All Python files pass syntax check. Bash script passes `bash -n`. JSON config matches run_ablation.py schema.
- Notes: Training not yet run (OOM constraint with llama.cpp). Branch is clean fast-forward over Phase-B-Training. Stash@{0} proposer_llm.py confirmed superseded; stash can be dropped after user verification.
- Follow-up: Run ablation via Lazarus script, generate capability reports, compare variants on held-out windows.

## 2026-05-02 - Episode Alignment Feasibility Check

- Changed: Added `docs/project-state/` as a durable handoff layer and recorded the PPO episode-alignment assessment.
- Validation: Inspected recent commits, training config, environment reset/episode logic, reward computation, task contracts, current README/docs, and relevant tests.
- Notes: Current PPO uses `batch_mode = "complete_episodes"`, so the immediate risk is not reward computation crossing episode boundaries. The open question is whether optimization should mix episodes from different regimes/horizons inside each PPO update.
- Follow-up: Run a controlled ablation before changing defaults.

## 2026-05-02 - Recurrent Solver Frontier Clarification

- Changed: Added `solver-recurrence-assessment.md` and updated project-state docs to distinguish the FiLM MLP baseline, the existing window-encoder LSTM, and a future true recurrent RLlib policy.
- Validation: Inspected `SolverLSTMModel`, `SolverMLPFiLM`, active training model config, local Ray version, and RLlib recurrent helper source.
- Notes: The existing LSTM processes each rolling observation window but does not carry hidden state across environment steps.
- Follow-up: Prototype a corrected window encoder head before implementing fully stateful recurrence.
